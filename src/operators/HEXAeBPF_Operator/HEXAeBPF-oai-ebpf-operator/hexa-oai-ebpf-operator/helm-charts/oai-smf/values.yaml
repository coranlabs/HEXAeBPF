kubernetesDistribution: Vanilla  #Vanilla for community kubernetes distribution else Openshift for Openshift

## In case of using these charts on Openshift then please use UBI images
## To know more about them follow this tutorial https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/cn5g/oai-cn5g-fed/-/tree/master/openshift

# SMF needs two separate interface one for http and other one for N4 to communicate with UPD. 
# But for experimentation only one interface can be used. 
# When you need multus:
# 1. you want separate interface for N4 and Nsmf 
# 2. Your UPF is outside the cluster and the host machine can communicate but pods can not then you can provide ip-address in the same range as your host machine
# 3. You want static ip-address for N4 interface, Namf can be discovered by its service name

## Change these ip-addresses according to your environment
