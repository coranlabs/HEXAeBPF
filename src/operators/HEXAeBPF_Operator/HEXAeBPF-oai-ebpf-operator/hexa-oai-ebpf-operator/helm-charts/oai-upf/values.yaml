## In case of using these charts on Openshift then please use UBI images

# oai-upf can be configured with multiple interface which may correspond to 3GPP logical interfaces. There can be one to one or one to many. 
# In case of one to one mapping n3,n4,n6 all can have separate virtual interfaces. 
# In one to many mapping n3,n4,n6 all can be mapped to one virtual interface. 
# Interface mapping is strictly based on your networking environment 
## Change these ip-addresses according to your environment
