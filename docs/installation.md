# Installation Guide

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coranlabs/HEXA_UPF.git
```

Clean your environment to ensure no configurations conflict:

```bash
make clean
```

Prepare the necessary directories and files:

```bash
tar -zxvf cord.tgz
cp -r cord ~/
```

## Deployment

```bash
make hexa-control-plane
make hexaupf
```

To remove all the components related to the 5G core:

```bash
make hexa-clean
```

To clean up all configurations and binaries:

```bash
make clean
```
